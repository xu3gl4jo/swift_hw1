 # Control Flow

 Control flow statements are used to change the execution order of lines of code.

 Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include `while` loops to perform a task multiple times;
 `if`, `guard`, and `switch` statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions;
 and statements such as `break` and `continue` to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

 Swift also provides a `for-in` loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays,
 dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

 ## Loops
 
 A **loop** is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be 
 carried out several times.
 
 ### `for-in`
 
 You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as ranges of numbers, 
 items in an array, or characters in a string.

 ### While loops
 
 A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. 
 These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations is not known 
 before the first iteration begins.
 
 Swift provides two kinds of while loops:
 - `while` evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.
 - `repeat-while` evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.

 ## Control Transfer Statements
 
 Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed,
 by transferring control from one piece of code to another. 
 
 Swift has five control transfer statements:
 - `continue`
 - `break`
 - `fallthrough`
 - `return`
 - `throw`
 
 In this Playground page, we would talk about `continue` and `break`.
 _(You know the `return` statement via function implementation, and the `fallthrough` and `throw` would be
   mentioned in further chapters.)_
 
 */
/*:
 
 ### `continue`
 
 The `continue` statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing and start again at the beginning 
 of the next iteration through the loop. It says “I am done with the current loop iteration”
 without leaving the loop altogether.

            continue
        }
        result += number
    }
    return result
}
sumOfEvenNumbers(to: 10)

/*:
 
 ### `break`
 
 The `break` statement ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately.
 The `break` statement can be used inside a switch statement or loop statement when you want to 
 terminate the execution of the switch or loop statement earlier than would otherwise be the case.

 ## Labeled Statements
 
 In Swift, you can nest loops and conditional statements inside other loops and conditional statements
 to create complex control flow structures. 
 
 However, loops and conditional statements can both use the break statement to end their execution prematurely.
 Therefore, it is sometimes useful to be explicit about which loop or conditional statement 
 you want a break statement to terminate. Similarly, if you have multiple nested loops, 
 it can be useful to be explicit about which loop the continue statement should affect.
