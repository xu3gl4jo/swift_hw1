 # Oven Panel
 
 This is a simple playground with a oven panel, but its implementation is not complete.
 Please implement it with following instructions.
 
 This oven panel comes with a slider to set the temperature, and
 there are 3 labels showing temperature in different units.
 
 > You have to open the **Timeline view** if you cannot see the panel.

 */

let ovenPanel = OvenPanel()
ovenPanel.showInPlayground()

/*:
 
 Obviously that the Fahrenheit unit (`°F`) and Kelvin unit (`°K`) are broken.
 They are just showing the same value of Celsius unit (`°C`).
